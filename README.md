# TemperatureTimeSeries
Temperature Prediction using Time Series Analysis
Overview
This project aims to analyze and forecast temperature data over time using time series analysis techniques. The dataset contains monthly temperature records for a region (e.g., Pakistan). We explore the dataset through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Seasonal Trend Analysis, and ultimately, use the ARIMA model to predict future temperature trends.

Dataset
Source:
The dataset used in this project contains historical temperature data. The columns in the dataset include:

Temperature - (Celsius): Monthly average temperature (in Celsius).

Year: The year the temperature was recorded.

Month: The month the temperature was recorded.

Example Data:

Temperature - (Celsius)	Year	Month
7.72768	1901	January
8.936	1901	February
16.9632	1901	March
21.2741	1901	April

Libraries Used
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: Support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization.

Statsmodels: Statistical modeling, including ARIMA for time series forecasting.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning and preprocessing tasks.

Plotly (Optional): For creating interactive visualizations.
